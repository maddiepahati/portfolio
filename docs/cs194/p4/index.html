        <br>
        <h2 style="font-family:arial;">Overview</h2>
            <p style="font-family:arial;">
                In this project, we were given multiple tasks related to morphing and averaging faces. The goal was to morph
                one face into another, compute the average faces given a population of people, and then extrapolate from
                that mean to create a caricature of myself. For the morph, I used the senior pictures of myself and my younger brother, Jerrick.

        <h2 style="font-family:arial;">Defining Correspondencies</h2>
            <p style="font-family:arial;">
                To get the smoothest transformation, we defined correspondencies between one face and another that maps
                mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, nose to nose, etc, keeping the ordering of coordinates consistent between
                the two faces. In addition, the four corners were added to the list of points.
                <br>
                <br>
                Next we compute the Delaunay triangulation at the midway shape, which is the average set of points between
                face1's correspondencies and face2's correspondencies. The Delaunay triangulation maximizes the smallest angles
                and was computed using scipy.spatial.Delaunay. We use the midway shape to ensure the triangulation
                will be the same for both faces because it is possible to get different triangulations when running the Delaunay on two
                separate images.
            </p>

        <h2 style="font-family:arial;">Computing the "Mid-way Face"</h2>
            <p style="font-family:arial;">
              Once we have gotten all the keypoints and triangulation, the next step was to compute a "mid-way face" before computing the
              entire morph. Using the triangulation found in the previous part, I warped each face to that shape, and then averaged
              out the colors.
              <br>
              <br>
              To warp each face to the average shape, I computed the affine transformation between each source triangle and its corresponding
              midway triangle. The affine transformation matrix was calculated using the following formula
              with inspiration from this Stack Overflow
              <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1092048">post</a>.
              <br>
              <br>
              Given transformation matrix T, matrix A with the target triangle coords, and matrix X with the source triangle coords,
            </p>
              <figure style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="images/original.jpg" alt="Eqn" style="width:400px;height:146px;">
              </figure>
            <p style="font-family:arial;">
              Where (a1,a2), (b1,b2), (c1,c2) are points of the triangle in the target image (the average shape) and
              (x1,x2), (y1,y2), (z1,z2) are points of the triangle in the source image, we can compute the transformation
              matrix T by multiplying X by A inverse.
            </p>
              <figure style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="images/transf.jpg" alt="New Eqn" style="width:400px;height:146px;">
              </figure>
            <p style="font-family:arial;">
              The corresponding pixel location in the source image can then be computed by multiplying the target point by
              the affine transformation matrix we just calculated.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:arial;">
              I used draw.polygon to find all the target points in each triangle, applied the transform to the corresponding
              point in both source images, interpolated the value at the point, averaged the two values together and then copied the average
              in the target image.

        <h2 style="font-family:arial;">The Morph Sequence</h2>
            <p style="font-family:arial;">
              Here we produce a warp that transforms my face smoothly into my younger brother's face. I produced 45 frames where each frame is a morph of the two faces
              but applied with a different weight from [0,1].
            </p>
            <figure style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="images/morph_me_jer.gif" alt="Morph" style="width:250px;height:376px;">
            </figure>
            <p style="font-family:arial;">
              As you can see, the hair and the chest area are not as smooth which is due to the low number of correspondencies in those areas. This can be
              fixed by adding more keypoints.
            </p>

        <h2 style="font-family:arial;">The "Mean Face" of a Population</h2>
            <p style="font-family:arial;">
              Using the
              <a href="http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/~aam/datasets/datasets.html">Danes</a>
              dataset, I computed the average face shape for the men and the women, morphed each face to their respective average shape,
              and the averaged all the images to get the "average" man and the "average" woman.
            </p>
            <figure style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="images/mean_men.jpg" alt="Avg Man" style="width:1014px;height:512px;">
                <img src="images/mean_women.jpg" alt="Avg Woman" style="width:1014px;height:514px;">
            </figure>
            <p style="font-family:arial;">
                I then morphed my face to the geometry of the average smiling woman and vice versa.
            </p>
            <figure style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="images/me_to_mean.jpg" alt="Me to Mean" style="width:1014px;height:271px;">
                <img src="images/mean_to_me.jpg" alt="Mean to Me" style="width:1014px;height:281px;">
            </figure>

        <br>
        <h2 style="font-family:arial;">Caricatures</h2>
            <p style="font-family:arial;">
              A caricature is an image where certain features are exaggerated. I created a caricature of myself by
              extrapolating from the average smiling woman.
            </p>
            <figure style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="images/caricatures.jpg" alt="Caricatures" style="width:800px;height:318px;">
            </figure>
            <p style="font-family:arial;">
              My caricatures, especially when alpha=1.5, looks quite qnarly but it makes sense because my shape is rather
              different than the average Danish woman.
            </p>

        <h3 style="font-family:arial;">Make a Morph Based on a Theme</h3>
            <p style="font-family:arial;">
              I dug up all my old school pictures and made a morph of me throughout the years from kindergarten to my high
              school graduation.
